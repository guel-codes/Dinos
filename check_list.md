# Checklist / ToDo List
- [ ] Pull dinosaur data fromt he JSON and build each dino object
- [X] Change getElementByID to querySelector/querySelectorAll()
- [ ] Access new objects and variables that are inside of the IIFE, so they can be referenced in the other methods
- [ ] Iterate through the list of new dino objects and compare each one with the new human object (this will need to happen before the tiles are generate and the form is removed)
    - [ ]comparison methods need to be inside of the dino constructor so that each dino tile has comparison data with the human object

- [ ] Generate tiles for each of the dinosaurs
    - [ ] add these tiles to the DOM

- [X] Remove form from the screen
- [ ] Display all information on button click
    - [ ] add even listener
