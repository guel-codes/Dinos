- [ ] Pull dinosaur data fromt he JSON and build each dino object
- [ ] Change getElementByID to querySelector/querySelectorAll()
- [ ] Create an animal class that the human and dinos pull from
- [ ] Access new objects and variables that are inside of the IIFE, so they can be referenced in the other methods
- [ ] Iterate through the list of new dino objects and compare each one with the new human object (this will need to happen before the tiles are generate and the form is removed)
